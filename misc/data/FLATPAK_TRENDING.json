Over the years, numerous extensions to the basic formalism have been proposed to account for abstract data types, object-orientation, hierarchies or new arc types.<br>Among them is the reference nets formalism, where tokens can be references to arbitrary objects, especially other nets, thus allowing nested net models. It allows Java inscriptions, has built-in List and Tuple types, offers test, inhibitor and flexible arcs and has a powerful synchronization mechanism.<br>",
