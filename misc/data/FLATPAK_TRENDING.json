    "description_long": "<br>Waterfox is a privacy-focused browser built for power users who value customization and control over their online experience. It pairs a privacy-first foundation with the kind of deep customization normally reserved for extensions and hidden flags.<br>Waterfox routes DNS-over-HTTPS through a Fastly-hosted Oblivious HTTP relay, disables DNS prefetching, blocks 0.0.0.0 lookups, and leaves Safe Browsing calls off so lookups stay private. Cookie-banner automation rejects consent prompts when possible, HTTPS-First is enforced, Global Privacy Control is declared, and telemetry, experiments, analytics, and ad feeds are stripped out.<br>Private Tabs let you flip any tab into an isolated session with its own history, cookies, and default search. Tab context shortcuts can copy URLs, unload sleeping tabs, or restart the browser with cache-purge options, while privacy-first ergonomics keep scripted pop-ups in tabs, prompt for new download handlers, and restore the classic status bar with live link previews.<br>Layout controls move tab bars, bookmark bars, restart switches, and status bars without touching userChrome.css. Switch between Waterfox, Lepton, and Proton presets, adjust icon weight, padding, autohide behaviour, and rounding, or load legacy userChrome and userContent tweaks. Modern web APIs such as WebGPU, WebCodecs H.265, Web Share, JPEG XL, CSS Masonry, and scroll-driven animations are enabled by default, and Startpage plus Waterfox Private Search ship as defaults with a separate private-window engine.<br>",

    "description_long": "bibref is a tool that helps discovering internal references in the Bible. It aims at finding citations of the Septuagint in the Greek New Testament in a mechanical way.<br>The Bible, a book that has been translated into many languages, is maybe the most important book has ever existed. Believers have evidence that it is God's word, written by various people being inspired by God himself.<br>The Bible has many internal references. Many of them connect the two parts of the Bible: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The books of the Old Testament are usually written in Hebrew, while the books of the New Testament are Greek. A natural question can arise: How can Hebrew texts be cited in the Greek text?<br>There are several research projects on this, and today it seems to be clear that many authors of the New Testament cited a Greek translation of the Hebrew text, namely the Septuagint, that was widely popular in the first centuries, and still popular in some Christian churches. Many Bible translations, however, mostly use only the Hebrew text as a basis of the Old Testament, because the importance of the Septuagint is not yet widely identified.<br>This software project attempts to support finding citations of the Septuagint in the New Testament automatically. The work is based on The SWORD Project.<br>The bibref package offers several tools that help in comparing the verses of the Septuagint with the verses of the Greek New Testament. The tools consider the texts of full books of the Bible as one unit instead of considering just separated verses. The texts are provided by the SWORD project from the modules LXX and SBLGNT. In the newest versions the module StatResGNT is also supported.<br>",

You can choose two different basic settings. Either you can choose the next word bei using the button „→“ or you can use the „Time based next word“. By this setting can be the duration of the word chosen. The selection is processed with a factor so that longer words are not displayed too short. This dynamic setting ensures that longer and more complex words are given more time to provide a natural and fluid reading experience. Reading can be started via the “Read” button. Experienced readers can even have more than one word displayed at once. This increases the reading speed even further.<br>This program offers individual settings to improve reading:<br>Background colour<br>Font colour<br>Font and size<br>Reading progress in the text<br>used to highlight which words took a particularly long time and which were read quickly.<br>In the , you can extend the display time for longer words.

One use case for cuneiform was on numerical tablets likely to keep track of taxes, inventory, calculations and many other things people encountered in their daily lives.
