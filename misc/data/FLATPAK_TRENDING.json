It pairs a privacy-first foundation with the kind of deep customization normally reserved for extensions and hidden flags.<br>Waterfox routes DNS-over-HTTPS through a Fastly-hosted Oblivious HTTP relay, disables DNS prefetching, blocks 0.0.0.0 lookups, and leaves Safe Browsing calls off so lookups stay private. Cookie-banner automation rejects consent prompts when possible, HTTPS-First is enforced, Global Privacy Control is declared, and telemetry, experiments, analytics, and ad feeds are stripped out.<br>Private Tabs let you flip any tab into an isolated session with its own history, cookies, and default search. Tab context shortcuts can copy URLs, unload sleeping tabs, or restart the browser with cache-purge options, while privacy-first ergonomics keep scripted pop-ups in tabs, prompt for new download handlers, and restore the classic status bar with live link previews.<br>Layout controls move tab bars, bookmark bars, restart switches, and status bars without touching userChrome.css. Switch between Waterfox, Lepton, and Proton presets, adjust icon weight, padding, autohide behaviour, and rounding, or load legacy userChrome and userContent tweaks. Modern web APIs such as WebGPU, WebCodecs H.265, Web Share, JPEG XL, CSS Masonry, and scroll-driven animations are enabled by default, and Startpage plus Waterfox Private Search ship as defaults with a separate private-window engine.<br>",

    "description_long": "<br>In Thrive, you take control of an organism on an alien planet, beginning with the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). Your goal is to survive in the environment, adapt your species by adding mutations, and thrive. Other species will emerge to compete with yours. They will evolve via a population dynamics driven simulation with random mutations - you must improve and spread your species to surpass them. The success of your species depends both on your skill in surviving as an individual cell and the changes you make in the editor.<br>In the Microbe Stage, you control a single microbe or a colony of microbes bound together. You swim through a watery environment to find the resources your cell needs to stay alive and to reproduce. Once you have reproduced, you enter the editor, where you can review how well your species and others are surviving, move to new biomes, and modify your species. Add new organelles, change your membrane, and change your cell's visuals. Your goal is to become a more complex lifeform by first evolving the nucleus to become a eukaryote, then using binding agents to form cell colonies, the precursor to the first multicellular lifeforms.<br>Current key features:<br>Control an individual member of your species and survive the environment<br>Predate on other species, use photosynsthesis or scavenge for resources<br>Edit your species to make it more successful<br>Compete with other species emerging on your planet via an evolution simulation<br>Explore different biomes<br>Fight other cells with multiple cellular level weapons<br>Try different gameplay styles by specializing in different energy sources in subsequent playthroughs<br>Learn about biology by using real compounds, organelles or parts inspired by real science<br>Spread your species via the biome map<br>Review and plan future actions by looking at population simulation results and graphs<br>Learn the basics of the game with a light interactive tutorial<br>The major goals of Thrive are to create engaging, compelling gameplay that respects our players’ intelligence, and remain as accurate as possible in our depiction of known scientific theory without compromising the former. Thrive is an open-source project, and anyone with game development skill is welcome to join our team. The game uses the open-source Godot engine with the C# programming language.<br>If you don't have game development skills, you are still welcome to join our fan community. We would love to have you along for the long ride! <br>",

It aims at finding citations of the Septuagint in the Greek New Testament in a mechanical way.<br>The Bible, a book that has been translated into many languages, is maybe the most important book has ever existed. Believers have evidence that it is God's word, written by various people being inspired by God himself.<br>The Bible has many internal references. Many of them connect the two parts of the Bible: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The books of the Old Testament are usually written in Hebrew, while the books of the New Testament are Greek. A natural question can arise: How can Hebrew texts be cited in the Greek text?<br>There are several research projects on this, and today it seems to be clear that many authors of the New Testament cited a Greek translation of the Hebrew text, namely the Septuagint, that was widely popular in the first centuries, and still popular in some Christian churches. Many Bible translations, however, mostly use only the Hebrew text as a basis of the Old Testament, because the importance of the Septuagint is not yet widely identified.<br>This software project attempts to support finding citations of the Septuagint in the New Testament automatically. The work is based on The SWORD Project.<br>The bibref package offers several tools that help in comparing the verses of the Septuagint with the verses of the Greek New Testament. The tools consider the texts of full books of the Bible as one unit instead of considering just separated verses. The texts are provided by the SWORD project from the modules LXX and SBLGNT. In the newest versions the module StatResGNT is also supported.<br>",
