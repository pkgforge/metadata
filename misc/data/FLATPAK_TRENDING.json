This makes it possible to use presets shared by the community.<br>The table of supported settings compared to Pit House can be found on the project website. This project has no official ties to Moza<br>and/or their software. It's 100% independent work based largely on hours of reverse engineering the protocol.<br>Boxflat supports saving/loading presets and automatic per-game application.<br>If a device misses an axis an/or a button, an automatic game detection fix will be applied. No need for other software/SDL hints to make them work.<br>Supported devices:<br>Wheelbases<br>Wheels<br>Pedals<br>Handbrake<br>Sequential shifter<br>H-Pattern shifter<br>Multi-function stalks<br>E-Stop<br>Universal Hub<br>Digital Dash v2<br>Generic joysticks (only detection fix)<br>Note: The udev rules found in the GitHub repository need to be installed for the application to work properly.<br>Boxflat will remind you of this in case of no rw access to the serial devices.<br>",

The effects of the gravity mean that although it's easy to learn how to play, and to enjoy playing, it could take a lifetime to thoroughly master.In order to hit your opponent, you can rotate you ship to aim in any direction, and you can change the power with which your projectile is launched - the initial speed at which it flies.Slingshot is free software as defined by the [WWW]Free Software Foundation, it is released under the [WWW]GNU General Public License.
