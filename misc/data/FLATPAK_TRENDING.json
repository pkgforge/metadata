Gameplay consists of joining numbers in a grid<br>and obtain the 2048 tile.<br>Use your keyboard's arrow keys to slide all tiles in the desired direction.<br>Be careful: all tiles slide to their farthest possible positions, you cannot<br>slide just one tile or one row or column. Tiles with the same value are<br>joined when slided one over the other.<br>With every new tile obtained you increase your score. If you think you can easily<br>get the 2048 tile, do not let it stop you, the game does not end there, you can<br>continue joining tiles and improving your score.<br>Originally created by Gabriele Cirulli, 2048 has gained much popularity<br>due to it being highly addictive. Cirulli's 2048 is in turn a clone of<br>the 1024 game and includes ideas from other clones.<br>",
