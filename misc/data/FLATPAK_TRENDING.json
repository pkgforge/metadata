One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.<br>FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.<br>SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.<br>UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.<br>SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.<br>100% FREE &amp; OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published.<br>POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.<br>RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.<br>FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.<br>SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.<br>PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.<br>We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

    "description_long": "RetroDECK is an emulation and retro gaming application powered by the ES-DE Frontend that allows you to catalog and play your game collection directly on Linux in one unified experience. It's inspired by other embedded emulation systems like AmberELEC, EmuELEC, CoreELEC, Lakka, and Batocera. The goal is to have everything you need included in one package, so no other software is required.<br>Currently in Beta, RetroDECK focuses on SteamOS, Steam Deck, and Linux Desktop. It uses Steam Input for controller inputs and hotkeys. For the best experience, play and launch RetroDECK via Steam, though manual tweaks via RetroDECK Configurator may be needed if played without it.<br>Thanks to the built-in RetroENGINE, RetroDECK can be used as a headless engine, and with Steam Sync, you can synchronize your favorites as non-Steam games (powered by Steam ROM Manager).<br>What is it in detail?<br>https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki_about/what-is-retrodeck/<br>How-to: Get Started using RetroDECK<br>https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki_general/retrodeck-start/<br>If you want to sponsor the project: <br>https://www.patreon.com/RetroDECK<br>The RetroDECK Community:<br>Blog: https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blog/<br>Discord: https://discord.gg/WDc5C9YWMx<br>Matrix: https://matrix.to/#/#retrodeck:matrix.org<br>Lemmy Community: https://lemmy.zip/c/retrodeck<br>Subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/retrodeck<br>Bluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/retrodeck.net",

The developers of Manyverse can control the source code to build the app and ship new features, but they have no access to user data. The user has complete ownership and responsibility over their data.The primary goal of this project is to make social networking independent of internet connectivity. Hence the slogan . This quality is essential for populations disconnected from the internet (such as in Africa and Latin America) who want to benefit from modern social networking to communicate in their communities.The secondary goal of this project is to make social networking a neutral public utility for people of all kinds. Neutrality requires this project to be non-commercial, so that profit seeking never interferes with communications between its users, even in the long run. Neutrality also requires that the software developers have no access to and no liability for user content, to create an unbiased environment. Like the internet and the web are decentralized protocols, their inventors are also not liable for content on the web, and thus the web is a more neutral space than proprietary social medias such as Twitter or LinkedIn.Underneath, Manyverse uses the Secure Scuttlebutt protocol, also known as SSB. This protocol is somewhat like HTTP or RSS, in the sense that it describes how different apps can communicate with each other over the internet or over other networking channels such as Bluetooth. There are other SSB apps which Manyverse can interoperate with, such as Patchwork, Patchbay, Patchfox, and others.",
