This makes it possible to use presets shared by the community.<br>The table of supported settings compared to Pit House can be found on the project website. This project has no official ties to Moza<br>and/or their software. It's 100% independent work based largely on hours of reverse engineering the protocol.<br>Boxflat supports saving/loading presets and automatic per-game application.<br>If a device misses an axis an/or a button, an automatic game detection fix will be applied. No need for other software/SDL hints to make them work.<br>Supported devices:<br>Wheelbases<br>Wheels<br>Pedals<br>Handbrake<br>Sequential shifter<br>H-Pattern shifter<br>Multi-function stalks<br>E-Stop<br>Universal Hub<br>Digital Dash v2<br>Generic joysticks (only detection fix)<br>Note: The udev rules found in the GitHub repository need to be installed for the application to work properly.<br>Boxflat will remind you of this in case of no rw access to the serial devices.<br>",

This means that this app is very good at things such as drawing sketches of the solar system to scale, or just drawing any massive objects with tiny details. Of course, this app is also perfectly well suited for use as a normal canvas.<br>Features:<br>Infinite canvas, with infinite zoom<br>Open online lobbies for collaboration<br>Graphics tablet support (Pressure sensitive brush and eraser detection)<br>Saveable color palettes<br>Right click to open a quick menu<br>Place bookmarks on the canvas to jump to later<br>Undo/Redo<br>Screenshot tool to export parts of the canvas to a picture<br>Other tools such as: Textbox tool, Transform tool, Color picker tool, Square and Ellipse tools<br>Copy and paste objects on the canvas, and between different canvases<br>Insert images and files on the canvas<br>",
