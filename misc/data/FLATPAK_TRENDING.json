    "description_long": "<br>Boxflat enables you to change your Moza Racing hardware settings with ease as well<br>as adding SDL/Proton detection fixes for any of your devices (pedals, shifters, handbrakes etc.) from other brands.<br>Settings and their values are a 1:1 match with Pit House. This makes it possible to use presets shared by the community.<br>The table of supported settings compared to Pit House can be found on the project website. This project has no official ties to Moza<br>and/or their software. It's 100% independent work based largely on hours of reverse engineering the protocol.<br>Boxflat supports saving/loading presets and automatic per-game application.<br>If a device misses an axis an/or a button, an automatic game detection fix will be applied. No need for other software/SDL hints to make them work.<br>Supported devices:<br>Wheelbases<br>Wheels<br>Pedals<br>Handbrake<br>Sequential shifter<br>H-Pattern shifter<br>Multi-function stalks<br>E-Stop<br>Universal Hub<br>Digital Dash v2<br>Generic joysticks (only detection fix)<br>Note: The udev rules found in the GitHub repository need to be installed for the application to work properly.<br>Boxflat will remind you of this in case of no rw access to the serial devices.<br>",
