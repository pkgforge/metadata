By adding official support for Windows 95, 98, and ME emulation and acceleration, we hope that those old Windows games and applications could be enjoyed or used once more.

New data can be imported from a wide variety of filetypes, or generated by equation.<br>All data can be manipulated using a variety of operations such as the ability to select, cut, translate, multiply, center and smoothen data, as well as apply any custom transformations on the data.<br>Moreover, Graphs supports curve fitting on imported data and offers extensive customization options for the style of the plots. You can fine-tune and personalize stylesheets to your liking.<br>Graphs is an excellent fit for both plotting and data manipulation. The plots created with Graphs can be saved in a variety of formats suitable for sharing and presenting to a wide audience, such as in a scientific publication or presentations.<br>Additionally, the option to save plots as vector images allows for easy editing in software like Inkscape for further refinement. Graphs is written with the GNOME environment in mind, but should be suitable for any other desktop environment as well.<br>For any feedback, questions or general issues, please file an issue on the GitLab page.<br>",

    "description_long": "<br>Space Station 14 tells the story of an ordinary shift on a space<br>station gone wrong. Immerse yourself into your role, tinker with<br>detailed systems, and survive the chaos in this round-based<br>multiplayer role playing game.<br>Your custom character can spawn as one of dozens of crew and enemy<br>jobs, ranging from engineer to captain, or even a traitor, each<br>with its own unique gear. Your duties guide you through rich<br>interactions with complex mechanics, whether you're managing your<br>inventory, setting up the reactor, or flushing yourself down the<br>disposal tubes.<br>As disaster, incompetence, and sabotage strike the station, the<br>tension rises - opening up emergent situations that force you to<br>make hard choices. Will you patch up the medical bay after an<br>asteroid punches a hole in it, or fight for control when the<br>captain gets murdered by revolutionaries? Do you break out an<br>unjustly imprisoned clown, or sit back at the bar and serve drinks<br>without a care in the world?<br>The story of the station's collapse is in the hands of its<br>players, and each round is an intense, immersive experience that<br>will leave you wanting more.<br>SS14 is a remake of the cult classic Space Station 13. The game is<br>under active development and completely open source. Anybody can<br>contribute, even you!<br>",

The solution of continuum mechanical boundary value problems requires a constitutive response that connects deformation and stress at each material point. This problem is solved in DAMASK on the basis of crystal plasticity using a variety of constitutive models and homogenization approaches. However, treating mechanics in isolation is no longer sufficient to study emergent advanced high-strength materials. In these materials, deformation happens interrelated with displacive phase transformation, significant heating, and potential damage evolution. Therefore, DAMASK is capable of handling multi-physics problems. Following a modular approach, additional field equations are solved in a fully coupled way using a staggered approach.<br>The grid solver (DAMASK_grid) operates on structured grids.<br>",
