It does the routine and repetitive tasks for you by providing clever code completion, static code analysis, and refactorings. It lets you focus on the bright side of software development, making it not only productive but also an enjoyable experience.<br>The development of modern applications involves using multiple languages, tools, frameworks, and technologies. IntelliJ IDEA is designed as an IDE for JVM languages, but numerous plugins can extend it to provide a polyglot experience.<br>Use IntelliJ IDEA to develop applications in the following languages that can be compiled into the JVM bytecode, namely: Java, Kotlin, Scala and Groovy<br>Previously, IntelliJ IDEA was offered as two separate products: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition and IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate with extended capabilities. Starting with IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3, we're combining these two editions into a single, unified product: IntelliJ IDEA. This change allows all users to access essential functionality without needing to decide between editions. The core functionality of IntelliJ IDEA remains free and now comes with even more features compared to the former Community Edition. Additionally, the new Ultimate subscription gives you access to advanced tooling with a free 30-day trial available for all users when installing IntelliJ IDEA. Afterward, you can choose to subscribe or continue using IntelliJ IDEA for free.",

This allows you to write with white ink on a black background, which is much easier on the eyes in low-light environments like when the teacher turns off the lights in class.<br>Images and PDFs are also inverted, so you can still use a digital printout or a textbook without the fuss.<br>Saber uses a dual-password system to protect your notes from anyone but you, even if they have complete control over the server. You can safely store your notes on the official Saber server, another server, or even host your own!<br>The app is completely open-source so that anyone can view the source code and see exactly what it's doing and how it handles your data. Many other note-taking apps are closed-source and proprietary, meaning that their inner workings are a mystery to the public.<br>As someone who studies maths, highlighting multi-line equations was always a hassle with other apps, where the highlighter would change color when it overlapped with itself. Another problem I had was that in some apps, the highlighter would render on top of the text, fading it out and making it hard to read.<br>Saber's highlighter has no such issues. It utilizes canvas compositing to render the highlighter in a way that is consistent with/better than traditional paper, where it handles overlaps and maintains color consistency.<br>Saber has everything you need to keep your notes organized. Create folders inside folders inside folders to your heart's content with no limit on the number of nested folders. And even though a note may be buried deep within a nested folder, you can still access it easily with your most recent notes always available on the home screen.<br>Discover a whole new way to capture and organize your thoughts<br>with Saber.

    "description_long": "Quassel IRC is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client based on the Qt framework.<br>Distributed means that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central core that stays permanently online -- much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, and similar to (but much more featureful than) so-called BNCs. Re-attaching your client will show your IRC session in the same state as you left it in (plus whatever happened while you were gone), and this even when you re-attach from a different location. In addition, Quassel IRC can be used like a traditional client, with providing both client and core functionality in one binary. This so-called completely hides the distributed nature, so for a purely local installation, Quassel IRC can be setup very easily.<br>Cross-platform means that Quassel IRC is developed for and tested on Linux®, Windows®, and MacOS X®. It should also run on any other platform that is supported by the Qt library. Third-party mobile clients for Android and iOS also exist.<br>By modern we mean that Quassel IRC will have all the features you'd expect from an IRC client nowadays. It also innovates in many areas. For example, the GUI features a dockable nicklist and topic bar, or you can arrange your channel and query buffers in default or custom views, which are also dockable. This means that you can arrange your GUI as you please. The architecture allows for other innovations, such as on-demand creation of log files in custom formats from the backlog.",

One use case for cuneiform was on numerical tablets likely to keep track of taxes, inventory, calculations and many other things people encountered in their daily lives.

NEST Desktop bypasses this<br>requirement, but still teaches users how to construct and explore neuronal networks. A textual script is generated<br>from the constructed networks and sent to NEST Simulator; the network activity is then visualized in a graph or<br>table. It is a useful teaching tool, since the network graphs and network activity visualizations can be exported<br>to files that users can implement for their course protocol.<br>",
