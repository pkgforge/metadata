    "description_long": "bibref is a tool that helps discovering internal references in the Bible. It aims at finding citations of the Septuagint in the Greek New Testament in a mechanical way.<br>The Bible, a book that has been translated into many languages, is maybe the most important book has ever existed. Believers have evidence that it is God's word, written by various people being inspired by God himself.<br>The Bible has many internal references. Many of them connect the two parts of the Bible: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The books of the Old Testament are usually written in Hebrew, while the books of the New Testament are Greek. A natural question can arise: How can Hebrew texts be cited in the Greek text?<br>There are several research projects on this, and today it seems to be clear that many authors of the New Testament cited a Greek translation of the Hebrew text, namely the Septuagint, that was widely popular in the first centuries, and still popular in some Christian churches. Many Bible translations, however, mostly use only the Hebrew text as a basis of the Old Testament, because the importance of the Septuagint is not yet widely identified.<br>This software project attempts to support finding citations of the Septuagint in the New Testament automatically. The work is based on The SWORD Project.<br>The bibref package offers several tools that help in comparing the verses of the Septuagint with the verses of the Greek New Testament. The tools consider the texts of full books of the Bible as one unit instead of considering just separated verses. The texts are provided by the SWORD project from the modules LXX and SBLGNT. In the newest versions the module StatResGNT is also supported.<br>",

Re-attaching your client will show your IRC session in the same state as you left it in (plus whatever happened while you were gone), and this even when you re-attach from a different location. In addition, Quassel IRC can be used like a traditional client, with providing both client and core functionality in one binary. This so-called completely hides the distributed nature, so for a purely local installation, Quassel IRC can be setup very easily.<br>Cross-platform means that Quassel IRC is developed for and tested on Linux®, Windows®, and MacOS X®. It should also run on any other platform that is supported by the Qt library. Third-party mobile clients for Android and iOS also exist.<br>By modern we mean that Quassel IRC will have all the features you'd expect from an IRC client nowadays. It also innovates in many areas. For example, the GUI features a dockable nicklist and topic bar, or you can arrange your channel and query buffers in default or custom views, which are also dockable. This means that you can arrange your GUI as you please. The architecture allows for other innovations, such as on-demand creation of log files in custom formats from the backlog.",

NEST Desktop bypasses this<br>requirement, but still teaches users how to construct and explore neuronal networks. A textual script is generated<br>from the constructed networks and sent to NEST Simulator; the network activity is then visualized in a graph or<br>table. It is a useful teaching tool, since the network graphs and network activity visualizations can be exported<br>to files that users can implement for their course protocol.<br>",
