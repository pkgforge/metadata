With an object system similar to Geogebra's, it allows dynamic creation of both logarithmic-scaled and non logarithmic-scaled plots with very few limitations.<br>It's primary use is to quickly create asymptotic Bode plots, but it's extensible nature and ability to switch to non-logarithmic scales allow it to create other things with it, like sequences or statistical repartition functions.<br>Features:<br>Graphical objects (points, fonctions, Bode magnitudes...) management system<br>Complete object edition<br>Advanced history system<br>Diagram looks customisation<br>LogarithmPlotter is available in:<br>🇬🇧 English<br>🇫🇷 French<br>🇩🇪 German<br>🇭🇺 Hungarian<br>🇳🇴 Norwergian<br>",
