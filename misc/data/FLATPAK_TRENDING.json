One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.<br>FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.<br>SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.<br>UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.<br>SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.<br>100% FREE &amp; OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published.<br>POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.<br>RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.<br>FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.<br>SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.<br>PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.<br>We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

To reach the door, the character may have to hack other objects like platforms and bridges to change their position and scale. This may include changing water between ice, liquid, and steam to access different areas. The water must be in liquid form for the pipes to work. If the character ever ends up in a bad place, they will be reset to the nearest surface with no bad consequences.<br>Important controls:<br>Move Mateo: Tap the mouse or trackpad on the screen<br>Restart Button: Restart the level from the beginning<br>Pause Button: Open options to change audio/continue level/return to level selection<br>Eye Button: Click the eye in the bottom right to highlight hackable objects<br>Token Button: See which code tokens you have used in the current level<br>Zoom In/Out: Scroll the mouse wheel<br>Hacking objects:<br>Right-click on white highlighted objects to see and change their code.<br>Mateo needs to be close enough to the object.

The effects of the gravity mean that although it's easy to learn how to play, and to enjoy playing, it could take a lifetime to thoroughly master.In order to hit your opponent, you can rotate you ship to aim in any direction, and you can change the power with which your projectile is launched - the initial speed at which it flies.Slingshot is free software as defined by the [WWW]Free Software Foundation, it is released under the [WWW]GNU General Public License.
