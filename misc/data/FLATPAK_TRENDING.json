No more relying on online services for video compression, or the manual trial-and-error of re-encoding at various bitrates yourself.<br>Features include:<br>An intuitive, easy to use interface.<br>Automatic calculation of average bitrate (ABR), resolution, framerate, and audio quality each video is re-encoded with to meet the target file size.<br>Bulk compression of multiple videos to one output directory.<br>Customization of framerate limits, to ensure a clearer or smoother image.<br>A choice of codecs to encode output files with, including H.264, HEVC, AV1, and VP9.<br>The app attempts to retain as much audiovisual quality as possible for the file size given. However, extremely steep reductions in file size can cause significant loss of quality in the output file, and sometimes compression may not be possible at all. All processing is done locally — and as such, compression speeds are only as fast as your hardware allows.",

Gameplay consists of joining numbers in a grid<br>and obtain the 2048 tile.<br>Use your keyboard's arrow keys to slide all tiles in the desired direction.<br>Be careful: all tiles slide to their farthest possible positions, you cannot<br>slide just one tile or one row or column. Tiles with the same value are<br>joined when slided one over the other.<br>With every new tile obtained you increase your score. If you think you can easily<br>get the 2048 tile, do not let it stop you, the game does not end there, you can<br>continue joining tiles and improving your score.<br>Originally created by Gabriele Cirulli, 2048 has gained much popularity<br>due to it being highly addictive. Cirulli's 2048 is in turn a clone of<br>the 1024 game and includes ideas from other clones.<br>",
