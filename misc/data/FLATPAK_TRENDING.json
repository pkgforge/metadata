Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.<br>SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.<br>100% FREE &amp; OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published.<br>POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.<br>RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections.<br>FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.<br>SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.<br>PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace.

Octave is normally used through<br>its interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write<br>non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar to<br>Matlab so that most programs are easily portable.<br>Octave has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra<br>problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary<br>functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary<br>differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily<br>extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in<br>Octave's own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in<br>C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.<br>",

You can use this app even if you do not know anything.<br>This app pretends to be a way of learn but also somewhat of a game where you use your intuition and the previous things you learnt to avoid getting new characters<br>wrong, but you are expected to fail because you won't have at all times all the needed information, your shouldn't feel overwhelmed because characters are <br>introduced gradually, but it can certainly happen that too much information is presented to you at once if you are too good memorizing, you can wipe<br>~/.var/app/me.sergiotarxz.JapaChar/config/.japachar/db.sqlite at any time to start over or change the settings to make the game more slow, fast or challenging<br>depending on what do you want to get from this game.<br>It keeps a inner score of how much you know a character to give priority to ask you again about it if needed and introduces new characters when you are ready.<br>The BETA Kanji support now doesn't include (But did include in the past) KUN and ON readings since trying to memorize pronunciations of Kanji is discouraged for learners.<br>New BETA Word memorizing support<br>It works now without having to install any third party font.<br>There is a settings menu that allows you to tune your learning further<br>to your rithm, the numbers are saved with intro, if you leave a field empty<br>you will restore the default, good if you mess up with the settings.<br>This app doesn't and won't substitute studying the language using native texts, videos and audios, the goal is to reduce the initial barrier<br>of entry since the written script is wildly different than the latin one.<br>If you do not know any language based in latin script I cannot currently help you a lot with this app, sorry for that.<br>It is boring to develop alone, get in contact in sergiotarxz@owlcode.tech over XMPP to contribute, I talk both Spanish and English.<br>Do you have old phones around? It is very possible that some of them are capable of running Linux with Postmarketos, Mobian or Gentoo, try to test<br>the app there and help me to improve it further.<br>Would be nice to have sounds that I can put in the game to make it more engaging, if you are capable of designing Music or Sounds consider contributing<br>your abilities for this free software app to continue improving.",
