No more relying on online services for video compression, or the manual trial-and-error of re-encoding at various bitrates yourself.<br>Features include:<br>An intuitive, easy to use interface.<br>Automatic calculation of average bitrate (ABR), resolution, framerate, and audio quality each video is re-encoded with to meet the target file size.<br>Bulk compression of multiple videos to one output directory.<br>Customization of framerate limits, to ensure a clearer or smoother image.<br>A choice of codecs to encode output files with, including H.264, HEVC, AV1, and VP9.<br>The app attempts to retain as much audiovisual quality as possible for the file size given. However, extremely steep reductions in file size can cause significant loss of quality in the output file, and sometimes compression may not be possible at all. All processing is done locally — and as such, compression speeds are only as fast as your hardware allows.",

This makes it possible to use presets shared by the community.<br>The table of supported settings compared to Pit House can be found on the project website. This project has no official ties to Moza<br>and/or their software. It's 100% independent work based largely on hours of reverse engineering the protocol.<br>Boxflat supports saving/loading presets and automatic per-game application.<br>If a device misses an axis an/or a button, an automatic game detection fix will be applied. No need for other software/SDL hints to make them work.<br>Supported devices:<br>Wheelbases<br>Wheels<br>Pedals<br>Handbrake<br>Sequential shifter<br>H-Pattern shifter<br>Multi-function stalks<br>E-Stop<br>Universal Hub<br>Digital Dash v2<br>Generic joysticks (only detection fix)<br>Note: The udev rules found in the GitHub repository need to be installed for the application to work properly.<br>Boxflat will remind you of this in case of no rw access to the serial devices.<br>",
